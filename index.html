          <p>“I expect a lot out of a chocolate chip cookie. Not only does it have to be vegan, I’m also looking for a handful of characteristics. Crispy and crunchy while also chewy. Salty yet not too sweet. The perfect amount of chocolate and butteriness. All the while with a depth of flavour. That’s precisely why this recipe was created. Now, it may not be for everyone. And that’s okay. There are loads of plain, basic chocolate chip cookie recipes out there. This isn’t one of them. Fresh rosemary, black pepper, and Nutmeg amuse the tongue; while coconut sugar, molasses, and flaxseeds provide the perfect chew. Toasted pecans and oat flour provide a subtle nuttiness. A sprinkling of flaked Maldon salt pushes these cookies over the top, in the best way possible. All in all, these are my go to chocolate chip cookies. They’re a bit more on the savoury side and, well, highly sophisticated. Here is a picture.</p>
